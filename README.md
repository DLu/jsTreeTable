# jsTreeTable

jsTreeTable is a clone of [jQuery treetable](http://ludo.cubicphuse.nl/jquery-treetable/).
I wrote it, because integrating the original with Atlassian products was way too complicated. This version is very light weight and and uses compatible table definitions.

## Features

* unobtrusive
* light weigth
* self contained: no external images ...
* helper functions for dynamic tables
* [jQuery treetable](http://ludo.cubicphuse.nl/jquery-treetable/) compatible

## Requirements

```html
<script src="bla.js"></script>
```

```javascript
var editor = new EpicEditor().load();
```

## API

### Providing data

#### Attributes on TABLE tag

#### Dynamic rendering

You can dynamically create the table from any data structure, e.g. JSON obtained by an AJAX call.

### Rendering options

## Mixing with jQuery treetable
